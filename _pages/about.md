Hi, I'm CHEF-KOCH.

I’m a private independent freelancer from Russia/Germany who is interested in all things of technology. I’m getting excited about technology and I like to tweak, test and review all software and hardware which I come across on my daily Internet journey. 

I worked several years for Microsoft (networking section) and NVIDIA (CUDA section) and have a lot of Internet & coding related experience earned over my years on the world wide web. I try random people whenever I can and I also like to share my knowledge with others without forcing someone to give me something. I like to Blog because that's my passion. 

Founder
* CHEF-KOCH

Editors
* None

Guest Authors
* Guest Authors are in general heartily welcome.

On my site, you’ll find posts I’ve written on some of my favourite things and the Blog focus:

<p class="notice">
  <strong>Software and Security related News, Reviews & Tips | Android application News and Reviews | Digital Privacy | Hardware News | Cryptocurrency | Tutorials and Tricks | PHere and there something from the Linux corner, yep I do care! | Movie analysis or things I think are worth to talk about – deal with it! | InfoSec</strong>
</p>

I try to post 5 news per day, depending on how busy I am (_maybe more or maybe less_).

### Software Reviews

I post here and then a software review, these reviews are based on my personal findings, my opinion (this will be separated mentioned as a conclusion). The findings in these articles and based on the known facts, no matter if the original developer likes it or not.

* I do not believe in any marketing lies or snake oil products or fake recommendations. 
* I keep my reviews as objective as possible and mark my own comments & thoughts into it.
* I always do my own research and I check what is already spread on the Internet.

Keep in mind that possible mentioned problems within my articles might have been fixed over time or the product might be already end-of-life (eol). I usually monitor the software and  review it again from time to time.
