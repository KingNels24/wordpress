After almost 4 months the latest Assassin's Creed: Origins game got cracked, which means latest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denuvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denuvo</a> version is now pointless. At this point there is no statement from Ubisoft if there planing to remove the copyright protection. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_warez_groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracker group CPY</a> released a 54GB torrent two days ago. Most new games get cracked by hacker groups within weeks or even days of release at this point. Early last year, a slew of games had workarounds for their Denuvo anti-piracy protection put out in record time, starting with Resident Evil 7. Assassinâ€™s Creed Origins managed to keep its various layers of protection intact for much longer, however, due in part to a newer version of Denuvo than what past games were using.

There already 34 GB repacks from known groups like CoreRepacks &amp; Co. Last month Denuvo was purchased by the digital security company Irdeto and has already released a version 5.0 of its software. Dragon Ball FighterZ, released January 26, is the most recent game to use this version and remains uncracked.
