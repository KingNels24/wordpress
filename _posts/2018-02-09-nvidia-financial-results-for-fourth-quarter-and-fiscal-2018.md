<h2>The announcement does not say what areas Nvidia had what gain in</h2>

The most important details are missing, which means no one knows for sure on which sectors Nvidia got a boost.

<blockquote>"In a powerful sign of our progress, attendees at NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conferences reached 22,000, up tenfold in five years, as software developers working in AI, self-driving cars, and a broad range of other fields continued to discover the acceleration and money-saving benefits of our GPU computing platform.

Industries around the world are racing to incorporate AI. Virtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs. Hundreds of transportation companies are using our NVIDIA DRIVE platform. From manufacturing and healthcare to smart cities, innovators are using our platform to invent the future."

<h2>Final words</h2>

Looking at their revenue trend, gaming revenue is $1.739 billion in Q4 if I'm not wrong, professional visualization is $0.254 billion, datacenter is $0.606 billion, auto is $0.132 billion and OEM/IP is $0.180 billion.

Rumours and the AI hype could also helped Nvidia in the last quartal, especially the crypto-mining boom could explain their financial gain in this last quartal.
